1. Purpose

Fulliautomatix is the software that manages the DAQ of ASTERIX. It is responsible for ensuring data collected from the detector gets pushed off and processed in a timely fashion. Coordination is managed via the RunsDB, which both DAQ (wavedump/kodiaq) and the daemons interface with. For simplest usage, run via cron.

fulliautomatix.py [-h] [--transfer] [--process]
[--reprocess REPROCESS [REPROCESS ...]]
[--log {debug,info,warning,error,critical}]
[--run RUN [RUN ...]] [--dry_run]
